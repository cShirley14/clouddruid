						>: Seriously if you have never heard of it, do yourself a favor, spin up a VM and check
						it out. Version-controlled OS, where you can play, break, and test things painlessly, I
						vote yes every time! I only develop under this OS, and am a full convert.

					<li>Bash</li>

					Fun fact -- Recently, someone told me I looked too young to have had two careers! I
					actually used to be a certified educator. Armed with an M.Ed. from UNLV, I had the joy of
					nurturing the next generation of young D&D players as a club sponsor. Let's just say I've
					got the battle scars from wrangling those little ones to prove it! ðŸ˜‚ Running this blog
					evokes nostalgia from my teaching days in the high school and middle school setting. I
					hope the insights I share offer some valuable takeaways, cheers!
